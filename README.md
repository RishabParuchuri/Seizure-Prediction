# Seizure-Prediction
Seizure Prediction model using an LSTM


*A seizure is essentially a “short circuit” of the brain, where the nerve cells in your brain sends sudden and spontaneous electric signals. The electric signals can be represented by a spectogram. Electroencephalography is a device to measure the brain activity. By monitoring brain activities of epilepsy-prone patients (EEGs), we can use machine learning to accurately predict when a seizure will occur and warn a patient beforehand.*
